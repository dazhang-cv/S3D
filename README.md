# S3D: Single Shot multi-Span Detector via Fully 3D Convolutional Network

TensorFlow implementation of the single shot activity detection model described in our [BMVC 2018](http://bmvc2018.org/) oral paper [S3D: Single Shot multi-Span Detector via Fully 3D Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08069v2.pdf).

In this work, we present a novel single shot multi-span detector using a simple end-to-end fully Conv3D network. The network architecture is intrinsically simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS'14 detection benchmark, while maintaining fast runtime speed at 1271 FPS. For more details, please check the latest version of the paper.
